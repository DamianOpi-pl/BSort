PWA Icon Placeholder Instructions:

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create the following icon files:
- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels) 
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels)
- favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32 pixels)

You can:
1. Use an online icon generator (e.g., realfavicongenerator.net)
2. Create them manually using design software
3. Use the provided create_icons.py script with Pillow installed

The icons should feature the BSort branding with a blue theme (#0d6efd) and include a t-shirt symbol to represent the clothing sorting functionality.
